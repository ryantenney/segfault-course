**A crash course in modern C++ for engineers who already know how to code.**

52 lessons. ~400 exercises. All signal, no filler. You edit code, run tests, ship understanding.

---

## Why This Exists

You're a senior engineer fluent in C, Java, Rust, Go — or all of the above. You know what a pointer is and how to read a compiler error. You don't need another intro-to-programming course. You need modern C++ (C++17/20/23), and you need to learn it by writing code.

**segfault-course** starts at the compilation model and builds through value semantics, RAII, move semantics, templates, concepts, concurrency, and coroutines — ending with a capstone where you build an HTTP handler framework with routing, middleware, and serialization.

Every concept is taught through exercises. You read the problem, write the code, run the tests.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone <repo-url> segfault-course
cd segfault-course

./run build                # configure + build everything
./run exercise 01-01-ex01  # build & test a single exercise
./run lesson 01-01         # build & test all exercises in a lesson
./run all                  # build & test the entire course
```

First run auto-configures via CMake. Subsequent runs only rebuild what changed.

**Requirements:** A C++20 compiler (GCC 13+, Clang 16+, MSVC 19.30+), CMake 3.20+, and a terminal. No other dependencies.

## How It Works

Every exercise ships with scaffolding and `TODO()` markers:

```cpp
#pragma once
#include <string>

// PROBLEM: Passing std::string by value makes an unnecessary copy.
// TODO: Change the parameter to accept a const reference.
// WHY: Const references avoid copies while preventing modification — the
//      default way to pass "read-only" data in C++.

inline std::string greet(std::string name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
```

Replace the `TODO()` with working code and run the tests:

```
$ ./run exercise 01-01-ex01

 Lesson 01-01: Compilation Model

  [pass] ex01 - passes string by const reference
  [pass] ex01 - does not copy the input string
  [FAIL] ex02 - swaps two integers: expected 20, got 10
  [skip] ex03 - returns reference to largest (not implemented)
  [skip] ex03 - returned reference is const (not implemented)

 3 passed, 1 failed, 2 skipped
```

Exercises marked `TODO()` show as **skipped**, not failed. You can build and run an entire lesson immediately — unfinished work won't drown you in red.

## Curriculum

### Course 1: Foundations

*From "I know C" to "I write correct modern C++."*

The compilation model (headers, ODR, linkage), namespaces, value semantics, const and references, strings and string\_view, enums, auto, structured bindings, casts, RAII, smart pointers, move semantics, optional/variant/expected, and error handling.

**13 lessons, 103 exercises**

### Course 2: The Standard Library

*The containers, algorithms, and utilities you'll reach for daily.*

Vectors, maps, sets, iterators, the algorithms library, ranges and views, lambdas and callables, chrono, string processing, and filesystem.

**10 lessons, 78 exercises**

### Course 3: Types and Generic Programming

*Designing types, APIs, and writing generic code.*

Classes and constructors, operator overloading (including `<=>`), inheritance, Rule of Zero/Five, function templates, class templates, concepts and constraints, type traits, constexpr, forwarding references, and CRTP.

**11 lessons, 88 exercises**

### Course 4: Concurrency and Async

*Threading, synchronization, and modern async patterns.*

Threads and `jthread`, mutexes, condition variables, atomics, futures and promises, thread pools, coroutines, and async I/O patterns.

**8 lessons, 59 exercises**

### Course 5: Real-World Patterns

*Applying everything to production systems.*

Builder pattern, type-safe configuration, middleware chains, serialization, resource pools, event systems, HTTP request/response modeling, structured logging, error propagation, and a capstone project: a complete HTTP handler framework with path-parameter routing, middleware composition, and JSON serialization.

**10 lessons, 78 exercises**

## Exercise Progression

Exercises scale from single-line fixes to multi-class system design:

| Stage | Example | Scope |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Early | Change a parameter from pass-by-value to const reference | 1 line |
| Mid | Implement a generic `transform` using concepts and constraints | 10-20 lines |
| Late | Build a thread pool with a work queue and futures | 50+ lines |
| Capstone | HTTP handler framework with routing, middleware, serialization | Multi-file system |

## The `./run` Script

```
./run build                  # Configure + build all exercises
./run exercise 01-01-ex01    # Build & test a single exercise
./run lesson 01-01           # Build & test all exercises in a lesson
./run course 01              # Build & test all exercises in a course
./run all                    # Build & test everything
./run clean                  # Remove build directory
```

Exercise IDs follow the pattern `{course}-{lesson}-ex{number}` (e.g., `03-31-ex05` = Course 3, Lesson 31, Exercise 5).

## Project Structure

```
segfault-course/
  run                              # Build & test CLI (wraps cmake/ctest)
  CMakeLists.txt                   # C++20, strict warnings, CTest
  testkit/
    include/testkit/testkit.h      # Single-header test framework
  courses/
    01-foundations/
      01-compilation-model/
        README.md                  # Lesson explanation + exercise briefs
        ex01.h                     # Exercise file (you edit this)
        ex01_test.cpp              # Tests (read-only)
        ex02.h
        ex02_test.cpp
        ...
      02-namespaces/
      ...
    02-standard-library/
    03-types-and-generics/
    04-concurrency-and-async/
    05-real-world-patterns/
```

Each exercise compiles to its own executable. A syntax error in one exercise never blocks another from building and running.

## Test Framework

The course uses **testkit**, a purpose-built single-header test framework with zero external dependencies.

```cpp
#include <testkit/testkit.h>

testkit::test_runner runner;

TEST(runner, "vector push_back increases size") {
    std::vector<int> v;
    v.push_back(42);
    ASSERT_EQ(v.size(), 1u);
}

TEST(runner, "at() throws on out-of-bounds access") {
    std::vector<int> v;
    ASSERT_THROWS(v.at(0), std::out_of_range);
}

TESTKIT_MAIN(runner);
```

| Macro | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `TODO()` | Marks unfinished code; test reports "skipped" instead of "failed" |
| `TEST(runner, "name") { ... }` | Defines a test case |
| `ASSERT_EQ(a, b)` | Equality check with values in error output |
| `ASSERT_NE(a, b)` | Inequality check |
| `ASSERT_TRUE(expr)` / `ASSERT_FALSE(expr)` | Boolean assertions |
| `ASSERT_THROWS(expr, type)` | Verifies an exception is thrown |
| `ASSERT_NO_THROW(expr)` | Verifies no exception is thrown |
| `TESTKIT_MAIN(runner)` | Generates `main()` with colored output |
